What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.",

During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.",

She is registered for physics 12 in the fall.  Due to the pandemic situation we have been very worried that our child is not going to get the foundations in math and science that she needs. Thanks to Victor and his team of highly qualified teachers our concerns have been alleviated.  Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.  I truly believe that the public school system of distance learning cannot do what Victor and his team have done for my daughter.  She has been prepared for success as a direct result of professional teaching methods that work.",

Private credit courses were mainly grade 12 English over the summer and grade 12 math courses throughout the fall semester in the evening. I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.    Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!",

            <p>Chemistry is a challenging subject. Many students resort to memorizing formulas and hoping to plug in a number to receive the answer - and do well on tests.  Oftentimes the teacher will change the question - especially on application problems, where the student will get stuck, result in poor grades.</p>

            <p>Memorizing steps and equations doesn’t work in chemistry. You need to start with the foundation (such as naming compounds and balancing equations).  The next step is to understand the concept and know how to apply to specific problems. Then the next step is to go through a variety of application problems and learn important problem-solving skills. These are all situation-based questions that you will encounter on your chemistry tests and exams.</p>

            <h2 class="learning-s3-intro__title">Physics Tutoring in Mississauga</h2>

            <p>Physics is a challenging subject for a lot of students. The key challenge is that physics is problem solving based. Students are accustomed to math, where they will have a formula and “plug-in” the numbers to derive the answer.  For physics, you need to know which formula to use in the first place and how to change the formula according to the situation.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 16px;">Get help from our physics tutoring in Mississauga</p>
            
            <p>Memorizing steps and equations doesn’t work in physics. All questions in physics are application based, they are word problems. This means that your teacher can change the question slightly and your entire solution - the equation you use, the givens, the approach, will be all different.  Understanding the concepts and apply them, instead of memorizing equations, is the key to doing well in physics.</p>

                  <p>Students begin with their science courses in grade 9 and 10.&nbsp; Once they proceed into grade 11 chemistry, biology or physics, the foundational skill they learn in grade 9 and 10 become critical.&nbsp; For example in chemistry, if the student is not proficient in compound naming or balancing chemical equations, then they will run into difficulty throughout the course.&nbsp; Science is cumulative, therefore building a good foundation is the important first step towards success.</p>

                  <p>Students are mostly accustomed to plugging in equations in math and deriving an answer.&nbsp; In science however, there are application questions, which are “situational” based questions.&nbsp; These science application questions, require the students to combine multiple concepts to derive the solution.&nbsp; In short, they have to first know what science “tools” to use.</p>

                  <p>In science, many students underestimate how important it is to gain an in depth understanding of science concepts.&nbsp; Memorizing science concepts may work for a time, but will not prove as helpful later on.</p>
                  <p>When a student encounter application question, where he or she is required to “apply” a concept into a different situation, memorizing simply won’t work. Students should seek to understand science concepts, rather than memorizing them. Understanding a science concept means knowing the “why” or “how” behind the fact, behind the equation or formula.</p>

                    <p>Some of the units in physics are conceptually difficult, such as electromagnetism and light. To better understand a physics concept, try first to put it into plain English. Imagine that you are explaining this physics concept to a space alien, or your grandmother. What would you say? What is an electric field? What is Voltage? If you are able to understand the physics concept, and are not merely memorizing equations, it will make understanding equations and problems much easier.</p>

This can eliminate confusion, and help to isolate areas of confusion.</p>

                      <p>Grade 11 Physics can be a very challenging course as the material along with the strategies for problem solving will be very new for many students. Rather than following concrete steps, as in Math, students will need to know which equations to use beforehand, and will need to know how to manipulate different equations to achieve their desired result.</p>
                      <p>Physics also involves many word problems which can pose another challenge, however the good news is that you will slowly gain proficiency in extracting givens and variables.</p>
                      <p>This course is important for those who wish to pursue engineering or science in university, and is a prerequisite for Grade 12 Physics.</p>

                      <p>It is important not to simply memorize the equations.  It is far better to understand the reasoning behind such equations. Try to visualize the situation and identify variables and given in each different problem. Make sure you are tailoring your use of equations to the question at hand, and not just blindly following steps or processes.</p>
                      <p>In many cases you have to use multiple equations and combine them in different stages.  For each equation, tick the variables that you have a number to insert and circle the ones that don’t.  Then try to use another equation to find the circled unknown.  This tip can guide you through the confusion</p>

                      <p>Grade 12 Chemistry is one of the most challenging courses in Ontario high schools, along with Physics. Building upon the knowledge acquired in Grade 11 Chemistry, many of the questions are based upon possible situations since Chemistry deals with so many diverse elements (ie. The energy produced from chemical X and Y’s reaction). </p>
                      <p>Many students are unused to this kind of problem-solving strategy, preferring step-based, or formulaic ‘plug-in’ problems. However, if you are pursuing science in university, this kind of problem-solving will have to be learned.</p>
                      <p>The concepts within Grade 12 Chemistry are quitter complex, including enthalpy, orbitals, equilibrium and organic nomenclature, which is a particular challenge for many students.</p>

                      <p>An important tip to remember when studying chemistry is not to become lost in details. Always keep an eye on the ‘big picture’ concepts in any given unit. A good way to visualize these concepts is to organize them into a flow chart.  This will allow you to see how concepts are related to one another, and will help with tests significantly.</p>
                      <p>Always try to understand the “why” behind a concept, or rather ‘why’ a concept is important beyond mere memorization. For example, the boiling point of an organic compound can indicate the intermolecular force that is the force of attraction between molecules. Understanding these concepts will allow you to adapt to situational problems in chemistry.</p>

                      <p>Physics is often taken for those seeking to pursue engineering in university. Grade 12 Physics is an extension of grade 11 Physics, and if a student has done well in the previous grade, it is likely they will, with hard work of course, succeed in Grade 12 Physics.</p>
                      <p>This course begins with a review of Kinematics (motion) and Dynamics (forces), which will provide a strong start. Electromagnetism and Light are often the most challenging units.</p>
                      <p>In Grade 12 Physics there will be the expectation to excel at problem-solving techniques, especially in the manipulation of equations to extract unknowns and answers. </p>
                      <p>The workload in this course is quite heavy, requiring a considerable dedication of time in order to achieve above 85 percent, however with the right mindset, this course will be very rewarding.</p>

                      <p>Physics will require a great deal of practice, and it is advisable to dedicate around 6 hours a week to work through new problems if you desire to achieve above 85% in the course.</p>
                      <p>Some of the units in Grade 12 Physics are conceptually difficult, such as electromagnetism and light. To better understand a concept, try first to put it into plain English. Imagine that you are explaining this concept to a space alien, or your grandmother. What would you say? What is an electric field? What is Voltage? If you are able to understand the concept, and are not merely memorizing equations, it will make understanding equations and problems much easier.</p>

                  <p>In Grade 11, chemistry, students will be acquainted with both theoretical and technical knowledge. And they must be grounded in both areas to do well in the course. You`ll find that there are more calculations and equations in grade 11 chemistry. This means that you need a solid background in math to do well. However, chemistry in grade 11 chemistry isn`t so challenging. Besides, it's a good way to see if chemistry or sciences will be a great choice for you in the university.</p>

                  <p>In Grade 11 Chemistry, you will be presented with both theoretical and technical knowledge. And to do well in the course, you must be very good at both. There are lots of calculations to be done, but that doesn`t mean the course is particularly difficult. Perhaps, the biggest benefit here is that and the course allows you to weigh the possibility of pursuing chemistry, or science more generally, in the future.</p>
                  <p>Here`s a piece of good advice: make sure you have an understanding of Nomenclature as well as how to balance equations in grade 10 science before starting grade 11 chemistry. You really don't want to miss those two courses!</p>
                  <p>When you get to the calculations in the course, make sure to lay out all the steps one after the other. You may use a flow chart, with each box indicating your result for each step. Examples, in this case, include the values for mass of a chemical, volume of a gas, or the number of particles in a substance. This is a good way to make problem-solving much easier.</p>

                <div class="c-red-group__text">
                  <p>The key factor for student to succeed in SPH4U Physics 12, is to master problem solving techniques.  Questions in physics are situation based, so it is not straight forward as in plugging in numbers to an equation to solve a problem, which a lot of students mistakenly expect.  The student must learn how to derive and modify equations in SPH4U Physics problems, to isolate the unknown variables and list out all the givens, and start from there.  One key tip is to draw diagrams so one can visualize the problems, then identify the variables and parameters in that question.  We teach these important problem solving techniques in our SPH4U Physics 12 course.</p>
                  <p>The second factor is to understand the concept.  Many students rely on memorizing definition without have a good understand of the concept.  For example, what is voltage?  Students will memorize a textbook definition without knowing what voltage really is.  To master SPH4U Physics 12 course, the student must be able to explain the concept (such as voltage) in their own words.  Once the student understand the concept, the next step is to relate that concept to the equation.  This means that the student must understand what each parameter mean in the equation, and how they would change when the situation changes.  Why is it happening like that?  Going deeper into this will take effort and time, but the student will gain the understand and being able to apply them in problem solving situations.  Our course in SPH4U Physics 12 provide in depth lesson, including step by step explanation of the key concepts and their application.  In this way, it is easier for students to digest the materials.</p>
                  <p>The third factor is practice.  In SPH4U Physics 12, it is critical to practice a variety of questions and get familiarize with them.  This will ensure the student to perform well on tests and maximize the test results.  In our SPH4U Physics 12 course, we provide a variety of worksheets for our students to practice.</p>

                                <p>The average tenure of our tutors at QE is at least 3 years. Many of our tutors stay with QE for 5-6 years. In this way, they are experienced and have worked with hundreds of students. Many of them have taught our 110 hours credit courses. New tutors need to go through a rigorous audition process in order to join QE. This includes showing in depth knowledge on our tests while also being able to explain concepts in a way that students can understand.</p>

What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education.

                      <div class="p-review-card__text">At a time when school had to be done differently, Queen Elizabeth Academy stepped up to the plate.  During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></div>

She is registered for physics 12 in the fall.  Due to the pandemic situation we have been very worried that our child is not going to get the foundations in math and science that she needs. <span class="wp-more">Thanks to Victor and his team of highly qualified teachers our concerns have been alleviated.  Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.  I truly believe that the public school system of distance learning cannot do what Victor and his team have done for my daughter.

Private credit courses were mainly grade 12 English over the summer and grade 12 math courses throughout the <span class="wp-more">fall semester in the evening. I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></div>

What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

                                <span class="wp-google-text">At a time when school had to be done differently, Queen Elizabeth Academy stepped up to the plate.  During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.

I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

We'd heard great things about Victor and the Queen Elizabeth Academy from friends who had <span class="wp-more">kids take fast track classes.  The low student to teacher ratio and the extra 1:1 care they provide really helps bring out the engagement compared to a 33 student class.  My son has greatly enjoyed the course--though summer classes are intense and fast paced.  All the more reason for extra attention during instruction.  We would recommend Victor and his team of instructors for any of the accredited high school programs they are offering.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Given this we put put her back to QE  to upgrade her mark too prepareand ensure she had background for university.  Not only have we seen a 15-20% bump in mark but we have seen her confidence soar because the teacher teaches the content, ensures they understand and truly cares during covid- yes online has been fantastic! Money well spent and calc.will be with QE since public education in math is failing miserably.

They make sure that each kid in the class understand the unit. The classes are so well organized online and they flow smoothly. We are very glad we signed up for the summer school wit QEA.
